# React Soundboard
Soundboard written using ReactJS.

## To do
- Styling
  - Each soundboard will have it's own theme (i.e. colours, fonts etc.)
- Need to cache soundboard JSON data so that it doesn't need to be ajax'd every time
- Soundboards should be able to have images instead of text chars as buttons.
- Add "glow" animation to button in soundboard when clicked.

## How the app works
