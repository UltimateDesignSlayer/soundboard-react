# React Soundboard
Soundboard written using ReactJS.

## Start up
`npm install` - install required node packages.

`npm start` - Fires up the Express server.

`webpack --watch` - start webpack watcher during development.

## To do
- JSON data should have optional alternate sound mp3 as well, with a whole new set of startTime and endTimes. This could be used, for example, if we were to have one soundboard with 2 sets of sounds but the same buttons. E.g. Jungle Animals soundboard could have one MP3 which has the names of each animal, and another MP3 which has the animal sounds. A "switch" would be presented on the soundboard for the user to select between the two.

- Need to cache soundboard JSON data so that it doesn't need to be ajax'd every time
- Add "glow" animation to button in soundboard when clicked.

## How the app works
Coming soon...
