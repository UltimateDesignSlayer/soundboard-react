# React Soundboard
Soundboard written using ReactJS.

## To do
- Styling
  - Each soundboard will have it's own theme (i.e. colours, fonts etc.)
- Set up app to fire up dev server and all watchers on _npm run dev_ command 
  - Seems we need to install node-sass globally else can't run node-sass command: *sudo npm install -g node-sass*
- Use NPM scripts as opposed to gulp/grunt.

## How the app works
